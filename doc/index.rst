This is first draft of documentation.

`Gap <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gap>`__ is Python project template and framework for `Google Appengine <https://developers.google.com/appengine/>`__ inspired by outstanding `Django framework <djangoproject.org>`__ and best `Python practices <https://www.google.com/search?q=python+best+practices+pip+virtualenv+tests>`__. It tries to get most of GAE standard libraries composed together in a handy way with addition of few lines of code making the development easier.

- `simple routing <routes.rst>`__
- `settings in GAE storage <settings.rst>`__
