This is first draft of documentation.

`Gap <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gap>`__ is Python project template and framework for `Google Appengine <https://developers.google.com/appengine/>`__ inspired by outstanding `Django framework <djangoproject.org>`__ and best `Python practices <https://www.google.com/search?q=python+best+practices+pip+virtualenv+tests>`__. It tries to get most of GAE standard libraries composed together in a handy way with addition of few lines of code making the development easier.

- `gip - pip installer for GAE project <gip.rst>`__
- `simple routing <routes.rst>`__
- `settings - efective cached configuration in storage <settings.rst>`__
- `templates - preconfigured Jinja2 templates <template.rst>`__
- `Gap is extensible by packages <modules.rst>`__

Other documentation is on the way.
