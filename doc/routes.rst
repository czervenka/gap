routes
======

Url routing to views is realized using `webapp2 routes <http://webapp-improved.appspot.com/guide/routing.html>`__ included in Google Appengine.

The generated project is set to allow include routes recursively. Gap provides special route ``include`` for this purpose.

See `src/routes.py <../gap/templates/src/routes.py>`__ for example of use.
